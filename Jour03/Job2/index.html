<!--There will be 2 containers, one will be empty at first and the second one will have parts of a rainbow shuffled by default 
    There is 6 parts of a rainbow, each named 'arc1..... arc6'
    The goal here is the have a button and called 'Melanger', this button will mix the pictures in random places,
    and the goal will be to click on the right part of the rainbow, starting from 1-6 if it's the wrong one the click will simply not do anything
    if the right part of the rainbow has been clicked that piece of rainbow will jump to the top in the corresponding place
    When the rainbow is complete on top, it will show (Congrats!!!!) 
    all of this is an exercice to get familiarised with Jquery and DOM manipulation -->
